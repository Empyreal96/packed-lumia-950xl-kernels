NOTE: THIS WILL NOT FLASH ANDROID, YOU WILL HAVE TO TRY PORT FIRMWARE AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS.
THIS CAN FLASH W10M AND LINUX WITH ZIP BUT YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE THE ZIP YOURSELF, LINUX IS UNTESTED ATM

BE CAREFUL, YOU COULD EASILY WIPE PARTITIONS ON THE PHONE THAT WILL BRICK THE DEVICE.




REQUIRED:

- Grab the dtb file and bootaa64.efi from Linux guide.

- Make sure Bootloader is Unlocked. bootshim and uefi loader (WoA Deployer for details)




NOTE: When I did this I was using my SD card to boot.. but I will try to explain
my method how to normally with the Phone (Fadil booted straight from phone I think)



1) Unpack the downloaded TWRP img for Angler using Android Image Kitchen,
you will then have a 'ramdisk' folder in your Android Image Kitchen folder..


2) Delete ALL files INSIDE Android Image Kitchen's ramdisk folder


3) copy my ramdisk files into Android Image Kitchen's ramdisk folder.


4) OPTIONAL: We split Windows Data partition into 2 seperate partitions
13-14GB for Windows Data, 13-14 GB for TWRP Data (format doesn't matter, ext4, ntfs,vfat)


5) In the Android Image Kitchen's Ramdisk, go to /etc/recovery.fstab
edit the fstab to match YOUR phone's mmcblk0pXX layout..
e.g: if MainOS is mmcblk0p38, change fstab to mmcblk0p39 on the /system and /system_image lines
Same for Windows Data, EFIESP (and TWRP Data if you set it up)



6) repack the image with Android Image Kitchen so we get a new file 'ramdisk-new.cpio.gz' <-- this is the file we are booting with



7) Same as Linux, copy the bootaa64.efi and dtb file to your Phone: /EFI/Boot/, and add my grub.cfg + Kernel file and YOUR ramdisk-new.cpio.gz file



8) edit grub.cfg. replace the start of these lines:

linux /EFI/Boot/Image.gz

to 

linux /EFI/Boot/950xl.5.8-rc3.gz

and 


initrd /twrp-3.4.0-0-angler.img-ramdisk.cpio.gz

to

initrd /EFI/Boot/ramdisk-new.cpio.gz

save grub.cfg and close




9) disconnect the phone and boot, select TWRP from grub and *hopefully* it loads TWRP


If you want the W10M theme:
make folder in Windows Data Partition or TWRP Data Partition called TWRP, make folder inside TWRP called theme, 
go to the ramdisk folder, go to /twres, copy ui.zip to Data's TWRP/theme folder
Next time TWRP loads it should load the theme

Thanks to Fadil Fadz on Testing and ideas and helping with flashing W10M zips

This is a rough guide by me (empyreal96), not meant for wide use, just for people wanting to test.
Let me know If I made an error somewhere
