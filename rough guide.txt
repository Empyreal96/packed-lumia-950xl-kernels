You will need to install firmware-atheros bluetooth bluemon (I also installed bluez* rfkill and rfcomm)

copy the rampatch and TLV to /lib/firmware/qca/
(check dmesg to clarify what files the bluetooth tries to load)

blacklist ath10k_pci module
make sure ath10k_core and btusb modules are loaded

install kernel same as the 4.18.6 with dpkg
